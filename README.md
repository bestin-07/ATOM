# ATOM

# Abstract
ATOM is a manually controlled dual arm robot. The main feature which distinguishes ATOM from conventionally existing dual arm robots is the ability to mimic human actions, called the SHADOW feature. The unique interface experience in which we exploit the virtual reality technology along with image processing technology enables ATOM to be a versatile and precise robot. The special eyewear gives us the 360 degree vision as seen through the eyes of the robot in a remote area and the hand movement of the user is observed, read and converted into useful format to control the arms of the robot. This gives us the dynamic experience along with improved situational awareness while dealing with complex and risky operations. Here we are focusing on the ability of the robot to deal with deadly viruses in medical labs.This robot can also be used for other applications like bomb diffusing, search and rescue, nuclear waste removal etc.

# What makes ATOM different
We introduce a virtual reality interface that allows users to remotely teleoperate a physical robot in real-time. 
Our interface allows users to control their point of view in the scene using virtual reality, increasing situational awareness (especially of object contact), and to directly move the robot’s end effector by moving a hand controller in 3D space, enabling fine-grained dexterous control. 
The movement of the camera in the scene is controlled by the movement of a virtual reality headset worn by the user. We also designed a positional tracking system ‘BUCKMINSTER’ that maps the movements of tracked reference to get desired end effector movement. This interface allows the operator to move the robot’s effector in real space by moving their own hands. Combining them, we have a “dynamic experience” or “Tele-Presence” along with improved situational awareness while dealing with hazardous & complex situations.
