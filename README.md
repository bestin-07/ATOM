# ATOM - Advance Teleoperation Method

## Abstract
ATOM is a manually controlled teleoperation method with a unique **SHADOW** feature that mimics human actions. Unlike conventional dual-arm robots, ATOM integrates **virtual reality (VR) technology** and **image processing** to provide an immersive, precise, and versatile control experience.

With **special VR eyewear**, operators gain **360-degree vision** through the robot’s perspective in remote areas. Hand movements are tracked, processed, and translated into real-time control of the robot’s arms. This enables **dynamic telepresence**, enhancing situational awareness in complex and hazardous environments.

### **Key Applications**
- Handling deadly viruses in medical labs 🦠
- Bomb defusal 💣
- Search and rescue missions 🚁
- Nuclear waste removal ☢️

## 🔥 What Makes ATOM Different?
ATOM introduces a **cutting-edge VR interface** that allows users to remotely control a physical robot in real-time.

### **Key Features:**
✔ **VR-Controlled Teleoperation** – Users control their viewpoint using a VR headset, enhancing awareness of object contact and surroundings.  
✔ **Intuitive Hand Tracking** – The robot’s end effector moves in real space based on the operator’s hand gestures.  
✔ **BUCKMINSTER Positional Tracking** – A proprietary system that precisely maps reference movements to desired robotic actions.  
✔ **Dynamic Experience & Telepresence** – Combines immersive vision and real-time control for high-precision operations in hazardous conditions.
